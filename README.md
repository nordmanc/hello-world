# hello-world
This is the creation of my first repository. Learning a little about coding after a long hiatus.
I'm and engineer who has taken a break from my last job and now I am exploring new skillsets to build and add to myslef. Coding it seems continues to be both a giant mental hurdle for me to overcome but also a liberating force for building useful tools and solutions to problems that I want to be a part of. Now I am here to overcome some old fears, learn some new skills, and build some cool things.
